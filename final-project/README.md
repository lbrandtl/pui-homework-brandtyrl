# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## *Idea 1*

![Personal Portfolio](images/idea1.png)

I want to create a personal portfolio to show off my design projects and creative process and use it for job applications, but also   to have a compilation of my works. I want to make it interactive and fun, with customizable interfaces, such as animations that users can adjust themselves. I want to keep the portfolio accessible by making sure everything’s clear and easy to navigate. Mostly, I want it to show off the different range of projects I’ve done and give a peek into the ideas behind them.

## *Idea 2*

![Virtual Pet Simulator](images/idea2.png)

I want to build a virtual pet simulator for a fun experience that users can simply enjoy. I’m plan to make it interactive, where the pet reacts based on what you do with it, showing different moods or actions. I’ll keep it simple and accessible, with visuals that are easy to follow and clear instructions. The main component is just to have a playful experience, taking care of a cute, digital pet you can hang out with.

## *Idea 3*

![Personality Test](images/idea3.png)

I want to design a personality test that helps people discover insights about their personality traits. It’ll be interactive by asking questions that feel engaging and require some thought. I want to make sure that everything flows nicely so it’s smooth from start to finish, and then at the end, you’ll get a summary and representation of your personality type, giving people a way to explore who they are in a fun, casual way.

## Feedback Summary

In the lab session, I received some really helpful critiques on how to approach better the design of the websites I had in mind. First, I was advised to think carefully about the visual identity of each of my ideas. The suggestion was to make sure I have a clear vision of the aesthetic for each theme so that I can build interactions that make sense for the overall look and feel of my site. Knowing the aesthetics I want will, in turn, help me build cohesive user experiences as to the intended purpose behind my ideas, ensuring that the interactions I include feel intentional and actually enhance the content.
Another point was to spend some time exploring examples of existing websites to gather inspiration for the ideas I had. I was encouraged to look at different interactive sites to see how they utilized visual elements along with user engagement. By analyzing these references, I can get a better sense of what works and what doesn’t, or what I prefer or not, and draw from them to bring my ideas to life. Furthermore, to have a strong foundation of the interactions I want to include, I was recommended to build a mood board in order to lay out the overall imagery of the ideas I had in mind, to create these interactions that are engaging and aligned with the style I want to present.
A piece of critique that resonated a lot with me was the importance for me to ensure that the interactions I included would help to enhance the information I was attempting to convey rather than distract attention from it. This advice was important to me to hear as it reminded me that design should be purposeful. The interactive elements I include with my website should have a reason, which is to make the content I am conveying clear, engaging, and memorable for the user.  

## Feedback Digestion

In digesting all the feedback I received in the lab, they all felt important for me to consider,  and I’m excited to act on them for my designs. The comment about defining a clear visual identity for each idea is definitely something I’ll work on and should start with. It’s easy for me to get caught up in the interactions themselves, which in turn deters from the original intents of the idea. Having a solid visual direction as a foundation will make sure that everything on the website flows and feels cohesive. I’m going to start this time by mood-boarding the aesthetics and vibes I want to go with for the idea I want to pursue, which should help me see what elements could become interactive and what could enhance the user’s experience.
The suggestion to look at examples of interactive websites for inspiration is also something I should explore. I think seeing how other sites handle interactions and engage users could be very inspiring and spark ideas I hadn’t even considered. Doing so will also help me identify what works in terms of usability and visual appeal so I can learn from this website while also putting my creative spin on things. Exploring different sites and building a mood board will not only refine my vision but also let me learn effective, established techniques that already work.
Lastly, the advice to make sure my interactions actually enhance the information rather than distract from it is something I’ll keep top of mind. I always seem to consider the "wow factor" of interactions, so this critique really reminded me that there should be a balance. I want to give the user a great experience without losing the main point of the initial subject. Overall, these critiques were very insightful and are elements I will incorporate in my next design.
